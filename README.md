# Event Management System (EMS) Prototype - Assignment 1 Documentation
## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to register myself in the EMS so I can log in and start creating events  
    * This is implemented via the `register` route.
2. As a user, I want to create an event so that I can have patrons register for it once it is approved  
    * This is implemented via the `new-event` route.
3. As an admin, I want to view and approve events so that if the event details are good, it becomes visible to general users.   
    * This is implemented via the `admin-events` route.
4. As an user, I want to view a list of approved events so that I can register for the ones I want to attend.   
    * This is implemented via the `user-events` route.
